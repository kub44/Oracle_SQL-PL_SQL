# Oracle_SQL-PL_SQL
Online Pharmacy project made for University classes

## General info

The purpose of the project was to get familiar with everything I have learned during my studies at the University and to use it in practice by creating a database of chosen subject area.

## Setup
1. Run **creation_of_tables_procedures_triggers.sql** script using e.g. SQL Developer.
2. Using the same way run **insering_data.sql** script.
3. At the end of **inserting_data.sql** script I put an PL/SQL code which runs procedure responsible for making examplary transactions with randomly generated date.
4. Now the project is ready to be examined. 
5. In order to uninstall the project, run **project_uninstall.sql** script, which will remove everything that the above mentioned scripts created.
